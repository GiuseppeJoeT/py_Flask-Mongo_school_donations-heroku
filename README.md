# Python Flask framework project - Charts Dashboard

### Check out the live test project: https://young-chamber-49434.herokuapp.com/
#### To visualize the js charts you have to wait 30 seconds because the project 
#### is hosted by Heroku Free Account

The goal of this project is to expand on the skillsets and tools for creating a
meaningful interactive data visualization. 
To do this, we will use a dataset from DonorsChoose.org to build a data visualization that
represents school donations broken down by different attributes over a timeline.

The project will be covering a wide range of technologies: MongoDB for storing and
querying the data, Python for building a web server that interacts with MongoDB
and serves html pages, and JavaScript libraries: d3.js, dc.js queue.js and
Crossfilter.js for building interactive charts.
